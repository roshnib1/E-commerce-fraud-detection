## Overview
This project aims to develop an advanced fraud detection system specifically for multiparticipant e-commerce transactions. By leveraging user behavior analysis, anomaly detection, and ensemble machine learning models, the system enhances fraud detection accuracy and efficiency, contributing to a secure online transaction environment.

---

## Introduction
In the rapidly growing world of e-commerce, detecting fraud across multiple participants (buyers, sellers, intermediaries) is challenging. This project proposes a novel method that utilizes behavioral analysis, anomaly detection, and machine learning to identify fraudulent transactions. The system uses a multi-perspective approach for higher accuracy, leveraging ensemble models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost.

---

## Objectives
- To build a fraud detection framework tailored to multiparticipant e-commerce transactions.
- To integrate user behavior analysis, anomaly detection techniques, and ensemble machine learning algorithms for better fraud detection.
- To deploy the model as an API for real-time fraud detection in e-commerce platforms.

## Data Analysis and Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step for ensuring clean, consistent, and usable data for modeling. This includes:
- Handling missing or corrupted data.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Normalizing or scaling numerical data.
- Anomaly detection for identifying potential fraudulent transactions.

---

## Model Building and Training
The project employs machine learning algorithms such as:
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- AdaBoost

These models are trained on historical transactional data to identify patterns and anomalies indicative of fraud. Hyperparameters are tuned for optimal performance.

---

## Model Explainability
The trained models are assessed for explainability using tools like:
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for understanding feature importance and model decisions.
- LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) for interpreting individual predictions.

These tools help ensure that the model's predictions are transparent and interpretable, making it easier to understand why certain transactions are flagged as fraudulent.

---

## Model Deployment and API Development
The trained model is deployed as a RESTful API using **Flask**, allowing real-time predictions on new transactional data. The API accepts transaction details, processes them through the model, and returns a fraud prediction (fraud or legitimate).

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience with machine learning techniques for anomaly detection and classification.
- Developed skills in model deployment and API development using Flask.
- Learned the importance of data preprocessing and feature engineering in building robust machine learning models.
- Understood the use of model explainability tools to make AI decisions more transparent.
